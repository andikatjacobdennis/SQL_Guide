### 3. Build the Interactive Documentation Website Locally (Recommended for Contributors/Developers)

For the richest learning and development experience, including powerful search functionality, a clean interface, and real-time updates as you make changes, we highly recommend building the documentation website locally using **MkDocs** with the beautiful **Material for MkDocs** theme.

#### **🛠️ Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following essential tools installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.8+**
    * **Download**: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * **Crucial Step**: During installation, **CHECK THE BOX** for **"Add Python to PATH"**. This enables you to run Python commands from any terminal location.
    * **Verify**: Open your terminal/command prompt and confirm the installation by running:

        ```bash
        python --version
        ```

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
    * **Download**: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * Highly recommended as your primary editor for a seamless development experience with Markdown and Python.

3. **Git (for Version Control)**
    * **Download**: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * **Verify**: Open your terminal/command prompt and confirm the installation by running:

        ```bash
        git --version
        ```

#### **Setup Instructions**

Follow these simple steps to get your local documentation website up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    Get a local copy of this project by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/andikatjacobdennis/SQL.git](https://github.com/andikatjacobdennis/SQL.git)
    cd SQL
    ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment & Install Dependencies**
    It's best practice to ensure your `pip` package installer is up-to-date, then install all necessary MkDocs and plugin packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **💡 Why `requirements.txt`?** This file ensures that all required project dependencies (including `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocs-minify-plugin`, `mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin`, `mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin`, and any others listed in your `mkdocs.yml`) are installed correctly and in compatible versions, providing a consistent setup for everyone.

    * **To create `requirements.txt` (if you don't have one yet):**
        After you've successfully installed all plugins and confirmed your `mkdocs.yml` works locally, run this command from your project root:

        ```bash
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        ```

        Then, make sure to commit this `requirements.txt` file to your repository.

3. **Build and Serve the Documentation**
    Once all dependencies are installed, you can launch the local development server:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

    * Access your interactive documentation site in your web browser at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
    * The site will automatically reload in your browser whenever you make changes to the Markdown content or the `mkdocs.yml` configuration.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                                      | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mkdocs` command not found                 | Ensure Python is correctly added to your system's PATH during installation. If already installed, try running `python -m pip install --upgrade mkdocs` to install or update MkDocs globally.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Plugin errors (e.g., `PluginName not installed`) | You likely need to install the specific plugin. For instance, if `git-revision-date-localized` gives an error, run: `pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin`. **The recommended approach is to use `pip install -r requirements.txt` after creating that file.** If issues persist, try a forced reinstall: `pip install --force-reinstall <plugin-package-name>`. |
| Python not recognized                      | Reinstall Python, making sure to explicitly check "Add Python to PATH" during setup. Alternatively, manually add the Python executable directory to your system's PATH environment variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Broken internal links or build errors      | Run `mkdocs build --strict`. This command will perform a stricter build, highlighting any broken internal links or other configuration issues with detailed error messages, helping you pinpoint and fix them.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Missing `requirements.txt`                 | If this file is absent, generate it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after confirming all necessary `pip` packages are installed and working. Commit this file to your repository so others can easily replicate your environment.                                                                                                                                                       |
